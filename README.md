# Block-based Komura Equivalence (BKE) 
This is an implementation of BKE as proposed in GPU-based cluster-labeling algorithm without the use of conventional iteration: Application to the Swendsen–Wang multi-cluster spin flip algorithm.
It takes any image up to a size of 6000k x 6000k and creates connected components out of the foreground pixel. Background pixel should be set to black.
